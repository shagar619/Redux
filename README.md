# Redux

## üî∑ What is Redux?

Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications. It helps you write applications that behave consistently across different environments (client, server, and native), are easy to test, and can be used with a wide range of libraries and frameworks.

Managing state in large applications can become complex, especially when:
- manage the state of multiple components.
- update the state based on user actions or other events.
- ensure that the state is consistent and predictable.

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Installation core Redux

```bash
npm install redux
```

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Installation React-Redux

```bash
npm install react-redux
```

## üî∑ Redux Toolkit
Redux Toolkit is the official, recommended way to write Redux logic. It provides a set of tools and best practices to simplify the process of writing Redux applications.
It includes utilities for:
- **Store setup**: Simplifies the configuration of the Redux store.
- **Reducers**: Provides a way to create reducers using the `createSlice` function.
- **Actions**: Automatically generates action creators and action types.
- **Immutable updates**: Uses the Immer library to allow for simpler immutable state updates.

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Installation Redux-Toolkit

```bash
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit
```

Redux Toolkit TypeScript Quick Start:

‚öôÔ∏è **Project Setup**

Define Root State and Dispatch Types

`app/store.ts`
```typescript
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
import counterReducer from '../features/counter/counterSlice';

export const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    counter: counterReducer,
  },
});

// Infer types for dispatch and state
export type RootState = ReturnType<typeof store.getState>;
export type AppDispatch = typeof store.dispatch;
```

Define Typed Hooks

`app/hooks.ts`
```typescript
import { TypedUseSelectorHook, useDispatch, useSelector } from 'react-redux'
import { RootState, AppDispatch } from './store'

export const useAppDispatch: () => AppDispatch = useDispatch
export const useAppSelector: TypedUseSelectorHook<RootState> = useSelector
```

Create a Slice

`src/features/counter/counterSlice.ts`
```typescript
import { createSlice, PayloadAction } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

interface CounterState {
  value: number;
}

const initialState: CounterState = {
  value: 0,
};

export const counterSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'counter',
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    increment: (state) => {
      state.value += 1;
    },
    decrement: (state) => {
      state.value -= 1;
    },
    incrementByAmount: (state, action: PayloadAction<number>) => {
      state.value += action.payload;
    },
  },
});

export const { increment, decrement, incrementByAmount } = counterSlice.actions;

export default counterSlice.reducer;
```

Connect Redux to the App

`src/index.tsx`
```typescript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
import { store } from './app/store';
import App from './App';

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <Provider store={store}>
      <App />
    </Provider>
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```

Use Redux State and Dispatch in Components

`src/features/counter/Counter.tsx`
```typescript
import React from 'react';
import { increment, decrement, incrementByAmount } from './counterSlice';
import { useAppDispatch, useAppSelector } from '../../app/hooks';

const Counter: React.FC = () => {
  const count = useAppSelector((state) => state.counter.value);
  const dispatch = useAppDispatch();

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Count: {count}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch(increment())}>+</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch(decrement())}>-</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch(incrementByAmount(5))}>+5</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Counter;
```


‚ùì Redux solves several challenges in complex front-end applications:

- **State Management**: It provides a centralized store for managing the state of the application, making it easier to track and update state changes.
- **Asynchronous Actions**: Redux middleware like Redux Thunk or Redux Saga allows for handling asynchronous actions, making it easier to manage side effects such as API calls.
- **Predictability**: Redux enforces a unidirectional data flow, which makes the application state predictable and easier to debug.
- **Testing**: Redux's predictable state management makes it easier to write tests for your application.
- **Decoupling**: Redux promotes a decoupled architecture, where components can be easily connected to the Redux store without tightly coupling them together.
- **Scalability**: Redux's modular architecture allows for easy scalability and maintainability of the application.
- **Middleware Support**: Redux supports middleware, allowing for side effects like API calls and logging to be handled in a clean and organized way.
- **Time Travel**: Redux DevTools enables time travel debugging, allowing developers to inspect and revert state changes easily.


‚ùìDifference between Redux and Context API
|--| Feature | Redux | Context API |
|--|---------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | **Purpose** | State management for complex applications | Lightweight state management for simpler use cases |
| 2 | **Middleware** | Supports middleware for side effects (e.g., Redux Thunk, Redux Saga) | No built-in middleware support |
| 3 | **DevTools** | Provides powerful DevTools for debugging and time travel | Limited DevTools support |
| 4 | **Boilerplate** | More boilerplate code required for setup and configuration | Less boilerplate, easier to set up |
| 5 | **Learning Curve** | Steeper learning curve due to concepts like actions, reducers, and middleware | Easier to learn, especially for React developers |
| 6 | **Use Cases** | Best suited for large, complex applications with extensive state management needs | Ideal for small to medium-sized applications or specific components |
| 7 | **Community and Ecosystem** | Large community with extensive ecosystem of libraries and tools | Smaller community, fewer third-party libraries |
| 8 | **Data Flow** | Unidirectional data flow, making it easier to understand and debug | Bidirectional data flow, which can lead to more complex interactions |
| 9 | **API** | Well-defined API with actions, reducers, and middleware | Simpler API, primarily using React's built-in context |


‚ùìPure functions in the context of Redux

A pure function is a function that:

1. Returns the same output given the same input (no randomness or time-based logic).

2. Does not cause side effects, such as:

- Modifying external variables or state
- Making API calls
- Logging to the console
- Writing to disk or localStorage



In Redux:

Reducers in Redux must be pure functions. That means:

- They take two inputs: the current state and an action
- They return a new state based solely on those inputs
- They do not modify the original state (they are immutable)
- They do not perform side effects

#### üèóÔ∏è Example of a Pure Reducer:
```javascript
function counterReducer(state = 0, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'INCREMENT':
      return state + 1;
    case 'DECREMENT':
      return state - 1;
    default:
      return state;
  }
}
```

Why Redux Uses Pure Functions:

- **Predictability**: Given the same state and action, the same result is always returned.

- **Testability**: Easier to write unit tests because there's no external dependency.

- **Debuggability**: Easier to track state changes and use features like time-travel debugging.


#### üèóÔ∏è Impure Example (What NOT to do in a Reducer):

```javascript
function badReducer(state = [], action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'ADD_ITEM':
      state.push(action.payload); // ‚ùå mutating state
      return state;
    case 'FETCH_DATA':
      fetch('/api/data'); // ‚ùå side effect
      return state;
    default:
      return state;
  }
}
```

#### ‚ùìkey components of Redux architecture

The key components of Redux architecture revolve around a unidirectional data flow and a predictable state container.
Here are the core pieces:

#### üîë 1. Store

- Holds the application state.
- There is a single store in a Redux app (centralized state).
- Provides methods:

  - `getState()` ‚Äì gets the current state.
  - `dispatch(action)` ‚Äì sends an action to the reducer.
  - `subscribe(listener)` ‚Äì registers a listener that runs when the state changes.

```javascript
// store/index.js
import { createStore, combineReducers } from 'redux';
import { taskReducer } from '../reducers/taskReducer';

const rootReducer = combineReducers({
  taskState: taskReducer,
});

const store = createStore(rootReducer);

export default store;
```


#### üîë 2. Actions

Actions in Redux are plain JavaScript objects that contain information about an event that occurred in the application. They are the only way to send data to the Redux store and trigger state updates.

Each action must have a type property that describes the event, and it can optionally carry a payload with additional data.

- Plain JavaScript objects that describe what happened.
- Must have a `type` field (string) and can include additional data (payload).

```javascript
// actions/taskActions.js
export const ADD_TASK = 'ADD_TASK';

export const addTask = (task) => ({
  type: ADD_TASK,
  payload: task,
});
```

#### üîë 3. Reducers

In Redux, reducers are pure functions that handle state logic, accepting the initial state and action type to update and return the state, facilitating changes in React view components.

- Pure functions that take the current `state` and an `action`, and return a new state.
- Reducers do not mutate the state; they return a new copy.

```javascript
// reducers/taskReducer.js
import { ADD_TASK } from '../actions/taskActions';

const initialState = {
  tasks: [],
};

export const taskReducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case ADD_TASK:
      return {
        ...state,
        tasks: [...state.tasks, action.payload],
      };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};
```

#### üîë 4. Dispatch

- The method used to send an action to the store.
- Triggers the reducer to compute the new state.

```javascript
// components/AddTask.js
import { useDispatch } from 'react-redux';
import { addTask } from '../actions/taskActions';

const AddTask = () => {
  const dispatch = useDispatch();

  const handleAdd = () => {
    const newTask = {
      id: Date.now(),
      title: 'Design login page',
      assignedTo: 'John',
      status: 'Pending',
    };
    dispatch(addTask(newTask));
  };

  return <button onClick={handleAdd}>Add Task</button>;
};
```

#### üîë 5. State

- The entire app‚Äôs state is stored in a single JavaScript object within the store.
- It's read-only and can only be updated through dispatching actions and reducers.

```javascript
// components/TaskList.js
import { useSelector } from 'react-redux';

const TaskList = () => {
  const tasks = useSelector((state) => state.taskState.tasks);

  return (
    <ul>
      {tasks.map((task) => (
        <li key={task.id}>
          {task.title} - Assigned to {task.assignedTo}
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
};
```

#### üîë 6. Middleware (Optional but common)

- Used to extend Redux with custom functionality.
- Intercepts actions before they reach the reducer.
- Examples: redux-thunk, redux-saga, logging, error tracking.

```javascript
// With redux-thunk
export const saveTask = (task) => async (dispatch) => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/tasks', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify(task),
  });
  const data = await response.json();
  dispatch(addTask(data));
};
```

#### üîÅ Unidirectional Flow in Practice:

- User clicks "Add Task" ‚û°Ô∏è
- `dispatch(addTask(...))` is called ‚û°Ô∏è
- Redux sends action to `taskReducer` ‚û°Ô∏è
- Reducer returns a new state ‚û°Ô∏è
- Store updates state ‚û°Ô∏è
- `TaskList` re-renders with new task


#### ‚ùì`<Provider>` Component in React Redux

The `<Provider>` component in React Redux serves a critical role:
> üëâ It makes the Redux store available to the entire React component tree.

When you use Redux in a React app, you need a way to allow React components (especially deeply nested ones) to:

- Access the state (`useSelector`)
- Dispatch actions (`useDispatch`)

Instead of manually passing the Redux store down via props, React Redux uses React Context internally. The `<Provider>` wraps your app and injects the Redux store into the context, so any child component can connect to it.

üîß How It Works:

```typescript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
import { store } from './app/store';
import App from './App';

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <Provider store={store}>
      <App />
    </Provider>
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```

- store is the Redux store you created.
- Every component inside `<App />` (and nested below) now has access to the Redux store.

üß© Without `<Provider>`, Redux won't work properly in React:

If you try to use `useSelector()` or `useDispatch()` outside of a `<Provider>`, you'll get an error like:

> ‚ùå "Could not find react-redux context value; please ensure the component is wrapped in a `<Provider>`"


#### ‚ùì`connect` function in React Redux

It allows you to:

- Read data from the Redux store and pass it as props to your component.
- Dispatch actions from the component as props.

üîß Syntax

```javascript
connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(YourComponent)
```

1. `mapStateToProps(state)` function:

- In React Redux, the `mapStateToProps` function is used to connect Redux state to React component props.
- It's a function that maps parts of the Redux state to the props of a React component, and allows the component to access and use that state.

```typescript
const mapStateToProps = (state: RootState) => {
  return {
    // Map the Redux state to component props
    // For example, map the 'count' state to a prop called 'count'
    count: state.count,
  };
};
```

2. `mapDispatchToProps(dispatch)` function:

- In React Redux, the `mapDispatchToProps` function is used to connect Redux actions to React component props.
- It's a function that maps Redux actions to props of a React component, and allows the component to dispatch those actions.

```typescript
const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch: Dispatch) => {
  return {
    // Map Redux actions to component props
    // For example, map the 'increment' action to a prop called 'increment'
    increment: () => dispatch(increment()),
  };
};
```

‚úÖ Full Example:

```typescript
import { connect } from 'react-redux';
import { RootState } from './store';
import { increment } from './actions';
interface Props {
  count: number;
  increment: () => void;
}
const mapStateToProps = (state: RootState) => {
  return {
    count: state.count,
  };
};
const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch: Dispatch) => {
  return {
    increment: () => dispatch(increment()),
  };
};
const YourComponent = connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(YourComponent);
```
