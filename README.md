# Redux

## üî∑ What is Redux?

Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications. It helps you write applications that behave consistently across different environments (client, server, and native), are easy to test, and can be used with a wide range of libraries and frameworks.

Managing state in large applications can become complex, especially when:
- manage the state of multiple components.
- update the state based on user actions or other events.
- ensure that the state is consistent and predictable.

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Installation core Redux

```bash
npm install redux
```

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Installation core React-Redux

```bash
npm install react-redux
```

> Redux solves this by introducing a single source of truth and a strict set of rules for how state can be changed.

## üî∑ Redux Toolkit
Redux Toolkit is the official, recommended way to write Redux logic. It provides a set of tools and best practices to simplify the process of writing Redux applications.
It includes utilities for:
- **Store setup**: Simplifies the configuration of the Redux store.
- **Reducers**: Provides a way to create reducers using the `createSlice` function.
- **Actions**: Automatically generates action creators and action types.
- **Immutable updates**: Uses the Immer library to allow for simpler immutable state updates.

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Installation Redux-Toolkit

```bash
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit
```

Redux Toolkit TypeScript Quick Start:

‚öôÔ∏è **Project Setup**

Define Root State and Dispatch Types

`app/store.ts`
```typescript
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'
// ...

export const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    posts: postsReducer,
    comments: commentsReducer,
    users: usersReducer,
  },
})

// Infer the `RootState` and `AppDispatch` types from the store itself
export type RootState = ReturnType<typeof store.getState>
// Inferred type: {posts: PostsState, comments: CommentsState, users: UsersState}
export type AppDispatch = typeof store.dispatch
```

Define Typed Hooks

`app/hooks.ts`
```typescript
import { TypedUseSelectorHook, useDispatch, useSelector } from 'react-redux'
import { RootState, AppDispatch } from './store'

export const useAppDispatch: () => AppDispatch = useDispatch
export const useAppSelector: TypedUseSelectorHook<RootState> = useSelector
```

Application Usage

`app/App.tsx`
```typescript
import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'
import type { PayloadAction } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'
import type { RootState } from '../../app/store'

// Define a type for the slice state
interface CounterState {
  value: number
}

// Define the initial state using that type
const initialState: CounterState = {
  value: 0,
}

export const counterSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'counter',
  // `createSlice` will infer the state type from the `initialState` argument
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    increment: (state) => {
      state.value += 1
    },
    decrement: (state) => {
      state.value -= 1
    },
    // Use the PayloadAction type to declare the contents of `action.payload`
    incrementByAmount: (state, action: PayloadAction<number>) => {
      state.value += action.payload
    },
  },
})

export const { increment, decrement, incrementByAmount } = counterSlice.actions

// Other code such as selectors can use the imported `RootState` type
export const selectCount = (state: RootState) => state.counter.value

export default counterSlice.reducer
```
